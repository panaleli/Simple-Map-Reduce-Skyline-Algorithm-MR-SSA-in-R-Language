 Building a 4-nodes Hadoop cluster and use of the Map-Reduce Simple Skyline Algorithm (MR-SSA) based on the R Language 
 
# The Map-Reduce Simple Skyline Algorithm (MR-SSA) in R Language

Below we see, analytically the MR-SSA algorithms which have run in our 4-node computer cluster. These implementations are developed in R language, in two, four, six, eight and ten dimensions with a size of 2000 points of each dimension.
